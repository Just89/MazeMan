=======

Scripting language:       Actionscript 3  <br/>
Development environment:  FlashDevelop  <br/>

General description: <br/>
A prototype game where I tried to make a combination between Pacman and the use of mazes. My intention was to also 
add enemies but haven't gotten to it yet. This was a task was to make a small yet complete game in two weeks.

The object of the game is to get as quickly as possible through as many mazes as possible and collect as many "coins" 
as possible.
